1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,210
You may have noticed previously

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,580
when we were running the `cf target`

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,580
or `cf t` command, that you
could see the org and space

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,220
that we were currently targeted to.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,090
Orgs and spaces are logical separations

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,040
within a Cloud Foundry instance.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,430
Orgs divide up a Cloud Foundry instance,

8
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,840
and spaces divide up each org.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,083
Again, how you use these
is entirely up to you.

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,850
I can see the orgs that I have
access to by running `cf orgs`.

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,950
You'll notice that I
only have access to one.

12
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,410
This is not listing all

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,460
of the orgs that exist
in this Cloud Foundry,

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,890
it's just the orgs that I have access to.

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,130
And then I can see the
spaces within the org

16
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,980
that I'm currently targeted to,

17
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,220
which is my trial org here,

18
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,110
that I have access to, again
by running `cf spaces`.

19
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,280
And you can see that I
have two different spaces

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,513
that I have access to.

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,180
If I needed to change,
or set, my org and space,

22
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,370
the one that I'm currently working with,

23
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,890
that's just the `cf t`, or
`cf target` command, again.

24
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,820
You can pass the `-o`
flag for the organization,

25
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,740
and the `-s` flag for the space.

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,570
If you were just changing spaces,

27
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,470
so if I was just changing
to this test space,

28
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,110
I could just simply type `cf t -s test`,

29
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,913
and it would keep the same org.

30
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,710
You'll notice when we talk about labels

31
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,910
within Cloud Foundry and names,

32
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,620
that these orgs, these spaces,

33
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,210
they all have human readable names.

34
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,900
These are names that can
typically be changed depending on

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,920
if you have the right access control.

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,960
But these are just names
for humans to refer to.

37
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,760
And so if we go back to our
application that we pushed

38
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,740
in the first push exercise,

39
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,730
we gave that a name and
the name was, first-push.

40
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,650
This again is just the
human readable name.

41
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,580
There is actually a unique
identifier associated

42
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,710
with that application that exists

43
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,190
behind the scenes.

44
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,300
But this allows us to just do things like,

45
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,580
show the app details by
typing `cf app` and the name,

46
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,150
and not needing to know that unique,

47
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,840
very long string of characters

48
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,193
that make up the unique identification.

49
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,540
As we also said earlier, apps are always

50
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,100
scoped to a space or pushed to a space.

51
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,610
So you'll notice that this app exists

52
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,750
in a particular org in the dev space.

53
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,930
You cannot deploy an
application to an organization.

54
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,683
You're always deploying
applications to a space.
