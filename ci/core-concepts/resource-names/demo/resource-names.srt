1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,540
- So remember previously we had deployed

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,890
an application called `first-push`.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,020
That application, that name, `first-push`,

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,970
is simply a human readable label.

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,260
Each of the resources

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,240
within a Cloud Foundry
installation will have

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,710
a globally unique identifier
or GUID assigned to it.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,380
And so we can see that
GUID by doing `cf app`,

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,270
the name of the app,

10
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,540
and then `--guid`.

11
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,810
And this will be useful
when we start interacting

12
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,480
with the API a little bit,

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,770
but for now we just want to show you

14
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,500
that you can rename these resources

15
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,740
and that GUID won't change.

16
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,460
So there's a command called `cf rename`

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,980
and we give it the original name,

18
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,570
in our case `first-push`.

19
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,670
And then we give it a new name,

20
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,780
in our case `renamed-app`.

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,070
When we do this, the name changes,

22
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,110
but the GUID doesn't.

23
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,790
So if we actually rerun `cf app --guid`

24
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,083
we can see that it's exactly
the same GUID as it was before.

25
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,983
So again,

26
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:56,570
labels in Cloud Foundry

27
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,470
are there for human beings.

28
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,590
You can change those labels.

29
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,430
Labels are typically scoped to a space.

30
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,180
So you could have the exact same app

31
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,370
in a space for dev

32
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,510
and a space for test

33
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,190
and in a space for prod

34
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,000
with the exact same name.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,490
So it's entirely up to
you how you use those.

36
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,323
From here on out,

37
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:18,050
we actually don't need this app anymore,

38
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,860
so we can go ahead and delete it.

39
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,980
We can do that with `cf delete`.

40
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,040
The `-r` flag will actually delete

41
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,920
the routes that are
associated with this app.

42
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,490
And so we can go ahead and do that

43
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,120
and say `yes`

44
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,560
and our application will be deleted

45
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,653
and we'll be ready to
continue with the course.
