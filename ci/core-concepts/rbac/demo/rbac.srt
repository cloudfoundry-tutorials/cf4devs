1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,780
- You can see what users have roles

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,540
within an org by doing `cf org-users`.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,490
In this case here, I'm the only user

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,080
and I have the OrgManager role.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,120
Because I have the OrgManager role,

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,670
I could add users to roles
within my organization

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,550
with `cf set-org-role`

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,423
and I could remove users
with `cf unset-org-role`.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,350
Similarly, I can see the
users assigned to my space

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,100
with `cf space-users`,
the name of the org,

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,630
and the name of the space.

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,100
In this case, again, I am the only user

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,850
and I have the SpaceDeveloper
and SpaceManager roles.

14
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,150
Because I have that SpaceManager role,

15
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,140
I could add users to my space
with `cf set-space-role`

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,433
and remove users with
`cf unset-space-role`.

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,690
Lastly, it's sometimes
useful to just get a list

18
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,960
of the unique users that
are assigned to a role

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,550
within the org or within
any spaces within the org.

20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,960
And you can do that with `cf
org-users` and the `-a` flag,

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,500
of course, I'm the only
user within this org

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,683
and within any spaces within my org.
