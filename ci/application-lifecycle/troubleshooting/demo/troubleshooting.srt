1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,870
- The application SSH
feature can be disabled

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,590
for the entire Cloud Foundry instance,

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,240
at the space level, and
at the application level.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,840
We can check if SSH is
enabled at our app level

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,550
by doing a `cf ssh-enabled`.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,710
You can see that it is not
enabled for my 'training-app',

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,153
so I can go ahead and enable
it with `cf enable-ssh`.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,030
I also need to check at the space level

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,870
and I can do a `cf space-ssh-allowed`.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,083
You can see that SSH is not
allowed in my dev space.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,620
So I need to go ahead and enable that

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,933
with `cf allow-space-ssh`.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,370
Because I've made a
change to those settings,

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,010
I need to restart my application.

15
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,300
I'm gonna do it with the rolling strategy

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,193
to ensure that I have no downtime.

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,440
Once my application has restarted,

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,130
I can SSH to a particular app instance.

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,513
In this case, I'm going to instance zero.

20
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,760
And once I'm inside the container,

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,400
I can do a lot of things.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,240
I can look around.

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,430
It may be helpful to take a
look at the 'app' directory.

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,270
That's where our application code exists.

25
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,150
The structure of that directory will vary

26
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,200
depending on the buildpack
that you're using.

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,700
More commonly you'll use `cf ssh`

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,380
to tunnel to a service
instance like a database.

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,110
We'll show you that in a future exercise.

30
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,290
I'm gonna go ahead and exit
out of the SSH session.

31
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,050
Then it's always best practice

32
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,290
to restart the application
instance that we SSH to.

33
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,595
And that's just in case we
accidentally made a change

34
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:45,800
or did something to corrupt
that particular instance.

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,920
I can do that with a `cf
restart-app-instance`.

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,730
This is why I SSH specifically

37
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,920
to the index of zero so
that I could only restart

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,223
the index of zero.
