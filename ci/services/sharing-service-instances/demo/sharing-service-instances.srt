1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,100
- At some point you may need to access the

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,630
same managed service instance.

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,630
Maybe it's a database

4
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,300
or a message queue in
two different spaces.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,530
Cloud Foundry will allow
you to share those service

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,320
instances across those spaces

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,470
provided that you have the
SpaceDeveloper role in both

8
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,750
of those spaces and provided
that this feature is enabled.

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,290
So I've got another
space called 'services'.

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,550
I'm going to go ahead and
use `cf shared-service`

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,493
and share my training app
database with that space.

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,300
If I do a `cf service` in
my currently targeted space

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,680
which is my dev space, I
can see that there's now

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,180
a section here called shared with spaces.

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,463
And I can see that it's shared
in my other services space.

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,690
I can target that services space.

17
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,120
I can run `cf service`
on the same database here

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,530
and see that, that
database instance is shared

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,293
across into this space.

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,130
So from here I could go ahead

21
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,580
and bind it into an application
in the services space

22
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,870
or do whatever I need to do with it.

23
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,230
Instead, I'm going to go back here

24
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,180
into my dev space and
I'm going to unshare it

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,053
because that's no longer necessary.

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,220
And in unsharing that database

27
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,600
I can do a `cf service`
again, back in my dev space.

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,010
And I can see that

29
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,133
it is no longer shared
with any other spaces.
