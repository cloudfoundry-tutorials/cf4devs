1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
- I'm going to demonstrate

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,140
the use of internal routes

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,180
by moving the training application

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,473
behind a new proxy
application that we'll deploy.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,720
I'm going to start by running
`cf map-route` on the training

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,240
app and putting it on the
'apps.internal' domain.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,830
Again, this is the internal domain

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,723
that's not routable from
outside of Cloud Foundry.

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,070
I can then go ahead and
remove the existing domain,

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,780
the domain that was routable
from outside of Cloud Foundry.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,380
And so now my training
app is only accessible

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,483
on the 'apps.internal' domain.

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,380
I can see that by running `cf app`

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,493
and verifying the routes here.

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,650
So once I have that,

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,700
I'm going to deploy nginx
to serve as a proxy.

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,450
Now, this is just another
demonstration app.

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,160
This proxy isn't going to
do anything to our requests,

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,340
it's simply going to take
all requests coming to it

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,123
and forward those requests
to our training application.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,450
You'll see that I deployed the proxy app

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,660
to that externally facing route.

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,750
This is the route that
the training app had

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,313
before I removed it.

25
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,180
If I run `cf apps`,

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,470
you'll see that I have two applications.

27
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,890
One is our nginx proxy and

28
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,270
again, this is the
externally routable URL.

29
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,740
The other is our `training-app`

30
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,770
only routable from
inside of Cloud Foundry.

31
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,720
When I open a browser now though,

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,950
requests to our nginx proxy fail.

33
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,210
And that's because the
proxy is not allowed to talk

34
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,190
to our training application.

35
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,760
In order to allow nginx to
talk to our training app,

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,733
we have to add a network policy.

37
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,610
We can do that with `cf
add-network-policy`.

38
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,020
And we specify the application

39
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,200
we expect traffic to be originating from.

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,820
In that case it's our proxy application

41
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,480
to the destination app.

42
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,390
In this case, our training application.

43
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,520
It will be communicating over HTTP.

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,640
So the protocol is 'tcp'

45
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,303
and the port is '8080', the default port.

46
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,300
If we do this and then we
wait about 20 to 30 seconds

47
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,210
for that change to propagate,

48
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,670
we can go back to our browser,
we can refresh the page

49
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,083
and it looks exactly like we're
accessing our training app.

50
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,210
Except our training app, in this case,

51
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,670
is now on that internal domain only.

52
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,810
Now this is a very simplistic example

53
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,650
because again nginx in this case,

54
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,530
isn't doing anything to our requests.

55
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,510
It's not actually providing
any additional security,

56
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,170
but we could, inside
of ningx configuration,

57
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,120
do IP filtering, creating
allow lists or denial lists,

58
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,120
we could implement authentication,

59
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,720
we could implement logging,

60
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,550
or other logic that nginx supports,

61
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,630
thereby protecting our backend application

62
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,780
(in this case, the training application).

63
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,850
Remember that on this network,

64
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,460
we explicitly have to allow traffic

65
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,490
from one application to another.

66
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,900
And so if we no longer
want the nginx proxy

67
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,310
to be able to access the training app,

68
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,990
we can simply remove that network policy

69
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,410
and we've disallowed that path

70
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,243
from the proxy to the training app.
