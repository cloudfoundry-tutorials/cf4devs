00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,520
- In Cloud Foundry, you can
have an app with no routes

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,720
or you can have an app with
a lot of different routes.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,660
You can also have the same route

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,143
associated with multiple applications.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,490
You can see what routes you already have

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,933
in your space by running `cf routes`.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,760
You can see here that
I only have one route,

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,540
it's for my training app

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,000
and it's kind of messy, kind of ugly,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,190
and that's primarily because

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,830
we use that `random-route` feature

12
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,160
when we first pushed the application.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,240
So let's change it

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,340
to something a little bit more meaningful.

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,720
We can create a route in a space
by using `cf create-route`.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,210
The first argument here is

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,260
the domain that we're going
to create the route on.

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,470
And then we can also optionally
specify the hostname.

19
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,260
In this case, I want
to use the same domain,

20
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,540
but change the hostname to
something more meaningful

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,150
in this case, `cff-training-app`.

22
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,250
You'll note that I can create
this route in this space

23
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,453
without actually having it
bound to the application.

24
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,690
I can associate a route
with the application

25
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,240
by running `cf map-route`.

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,110
And the command looks very similar

27
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,340
except we've added

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,113
the application that
we're referring to here.

29
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,180
So now when I look at my
training app, by doing `cf app`,

30
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,290
I can see that I have two
routes associated with it,

31
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,870
the old route and the new route.

32
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,200
Let's get rid of the old route,

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,150
because like I said, it's kind of ugly.

34
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,410
We can do that by un-mapping the route

35
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,093
from our application
with `cf unmap-route`.

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
Now, if I look at my training app again,

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,160
I can see that I have a single route,

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,710
just the one route that I want.

39
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,423
However, if I rerun `cf routes`,

40
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,550
I still have that old
route left in my space.

41
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,550
And I want to clean that
up because it's not in use

42
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,700
and I'm not going to use
it for anything else.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,013
I can use `cf delete-route` to do that.
