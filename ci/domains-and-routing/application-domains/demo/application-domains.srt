1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,870
- So far in this course,

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,740
we've used a single application domain

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,140
that's already been made available to us

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,760
in the Cloud Foundry
instance that we're using.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,880
There may be other
domains available to you,

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,330
and you can see that by
running `cf domains`.

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,680
You can see that we have
the `cfapps` domain,

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,560
which I've been using.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,987
There's also a `cert.cfapps` domain,

10
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:20,910
and a domain called `apps.internal`,

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,840
which we'll talk about in a later section.

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,430
But you can also bring your
own domains to Cloud Foundry.

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,200
So your company may have their own domain

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,450
that they want all of
their apps deployed on.

15
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,220
You can add your domain to Cloud Foundry

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,090
by running `cf create-private-domain`,

17
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,870
the name of the org
that you want the domain

18
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,723
to be available in, and
then the domain itself.

19
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,340
You'll note that a shared private domain

20
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,330
is initially scoped to an org,

21
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,920
but you can see by the message here

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,280
that you can share the domain

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,023
with other orgs if you need to.

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,580
Once you have that domain,

25
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,880
you can essentially create routes on it

26
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,580
and map routes to existing applications.

27
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,850
And so, I've used, now, that domain

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,063
to map to my existing
training application.

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,560
Now, it's important to note here

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,260
that just because I registered this domain

31
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,410
with my Cloud Foundry instance

32
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,240
doesn't mean it'll actually work.

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,330
And in fact, in this case, it won't work.

34
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,480
I will not be able to access my app

35
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,610
in a browser on this existing domain.

36
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,120
And the reason is that I
also need to configure DNS

37
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,970
so that the domain is resolvable,

38
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,610
and I need that DNS entries
for `my-domain.example.com`,

39
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,280
to map to the Cloud Foundry
instance that I'm using.

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,080
I also need to configure SSL certificates

41
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,230
somewhere with my Cloud Foundry provider,

42
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,240
and that varies by provider depending on

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,500
how they have their environments set up,

44
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,210
but we need to be able to
have valid certificates

45
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,060
for `my-domain.example.com` as well.

46
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,270
You can also delete private domains

47
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,170
and get rid of them and clean them up.

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,850
And when you do this, the existing routes

49
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,933
on that domain will also be deleted.
