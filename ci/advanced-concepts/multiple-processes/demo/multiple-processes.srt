1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,580
- So far in this course,

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,430
we've deployed applications
that had a single process.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,620
But Cloud Foundry also
supports the ability

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,970
to push an application that
contains multiple processes

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,290
each running in their own container.

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,500
As an example, you might
have an application

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,820
that has a UI component,
which runs in its own process,

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,623
and a backend data component.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,160
We've provided a sample
application called 'multi-process'.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,520
You will see here that in the manifest

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,080
we've now defined two different
processes, web and worker.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,050
We've defined the number of instances

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,090
and in this case, we've
provided the start commands.

14
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,350
Given that this is all the same codebase,

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,540
Cloud Foundry needs to know

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,783
how to start the different components.

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,220
Provided that we have that,
we can push our application

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,923
just like any other application.

19
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,900
And once the application starts,

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,580
you can see in the output
that we now have a web process

21
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,060
and a worker process.

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,443
You can see the same thing when
you run `cf app` on the app.

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,430
With multi-process apps,

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,380
we can scale each process individually.

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,640
In this case, we still use
the same `cf scale` command,

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,580
but this time we use the `--process` flag.

27
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,573
Now we've scaled our web
process to two instances.

28
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,703
We can then scale our
worker process to three.

29
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,250
If we want to SSH to an application now,

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,090
we again specify the `--process` flag

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,740
because there's multiple
processes for our application.

32
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,130
We can SSH to the multi-process app,

33
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,033
but to specifically the web process.

34
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,900
We don't actually need to do anything here

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,250
so I'm just going to exit out.

36
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,590
That's all we need this application for

37
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,240
so we can go ahead and delete it.
