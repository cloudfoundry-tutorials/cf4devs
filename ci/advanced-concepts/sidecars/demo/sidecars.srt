00:00:00,076 --> 00:00:02,700
- We have provided a sample application

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,620
written in Ruby that contains a sidecar

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,130
that's written in Go.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,653
Let's start by taking
a look at the manifest.

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,570
Our sidecars are defined in
the 'sidecars' block here.

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,611
You can see that we have a single sidecard

7
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:15,444
named 'config-server'

8
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:20,444
and we've included
information on that sidecar.

9
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:24,468
For simplicity, we've included
the sidecar as a compiled

10
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:27,740
Go binary, but you could
use multiple buildpacks

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,653
if you wanted to.

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,580
Deploying this application is no different

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,670
than any other application.

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,113
It's just a `cf push`.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,720
When the application's
done starting, you can see

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,200
that we now have our sidecar
`config-server` deployed

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,963
as part of the application.

18
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,690
Let's SSH into the application container

19
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,190
and take a look at the
processes that are running.

20
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,400
When we do a `ps aux`, you can see

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,200
that we have the
`config-server` process running.

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,840
We also have the `rackup` process running

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,923
which is the start command
specified for our application.

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,610
If we open the app in the browser and go

25
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,330
to the `/config` endpoint,

26
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,993
we'll see a response.

27
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:19,210
What happened here is the Ruby app

28
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,410
reached out to the sidecar
process and got some information

29
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,623
on some fake environment
variables and displayed that here.
