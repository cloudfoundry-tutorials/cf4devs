00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,890
- In a previous part of the course,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,050
we showed you how to cancel
an active deployment,

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,510
rolling back to the previous
version of the application

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,980
that you had pushed.

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,990
In this section, we'll
look at rolling back

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,100
to a previous revision of your application

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,470
when there's no active
deployment actually running.

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,730
You can see the revisions available

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,040
for your application by
running `cf revisions`.

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,090
For my training app here,

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,173
you can see that I have three revisions.

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,860
There's one revision, number two,

13
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,210
where I've added a new
environment variable.

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,630
I can see that environment variable now

15
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,690
by running a `cf env`

16
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,863
and it's called `TRAINING_ENV_1`.

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,810
So if I wanted to roll back

18
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,650
to the revision before that, revision one,

19
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,800
I can do that with `cf rollback`

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,174
and specify version one of that revision.

21
00:00:54,174 --> 00:00:56,010
You can go ahead and say 'yes'

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,603
and wait for Cloud Foundry to
roll back to that revision.

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,400
Once that roll back is complete,

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,920
I can look at the environment again

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,730
and see that that environment
variable is no longer there.

26
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,440
So rolling back to the previous revision,

27
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,330
the app code could have changed,

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,730
the droplet could have changed,

29
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,290
the environment could have changed,

30
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,150
just depends on what had happened

31
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,763
in those different revisions.

32
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,000
I can disable the ability
to roll back an application

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,720
by disabling the revisions
functionality for an application.

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,560
To do this, I'm going to need the app GUID

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,930
because I'm going to have to use `cf curl`

36
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,403
as there is no command in
the CLI currently to do so.

37
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,120
Once I have that GUID,

38
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,780
I can use `cf curl` to disable
the revisions functionality.

39
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,810
If I do that now,

40
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,920
I can still see revisions
for my application.

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,210
But when I go to attempt to rollback

42
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,573
to a different version of my application,

43
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,593
that will fail.

44
00:02:05,398 --> 00:02:07,700
And of course, if I can disable it,

45
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,130
I can re-enable it
again by using `cf curl`

46
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,943
and now changing revisions
would be supported.
