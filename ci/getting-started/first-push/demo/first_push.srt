1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,720
Before we get too far into the course,

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,293
let's deploy our first app.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,140
If you logged out in the last exercise,

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,470
be sure that you're logged in again.

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,530
Remember that you can check
that with `cf target` and

6
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,500
make sure that you're logged in.

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,953
If not, log in however you choose.

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,930
We wanna make sure that
we're in the directory

9
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,630
where our application is.

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,230
So our first push application,

11
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,040
wherever you've downloaded
that on your machine,

12
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,040
make sure that you're in that directory.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,290
If you look inside that directory,

14
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,030
you'll see our application along with

15
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,260
a file called manifest.yml.

16
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,420
This file contains some
directives for Cloud Foundry

17
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,310
on what to do with your application.

18
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,923
Let's take a quick look at that.

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,560
There's a few things that we specify here.

20
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,250
We name our application,
this is just the name

21
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,890
that we'll refer to it
in Cloud Foundry as.

22
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,480
We tell Cloud Foundry to
allocate 32 megs of memory,

23
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,960
64 megs of disk, and
create a single instance.

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,740
We're using this flag, random-route,

25
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,990
we'll talk more about that later,

26
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,430
but that's just to ensure we
don't have route collisions.

27
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,310
Our application is a regular

28
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,600
static file application and so we're using

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,850
a thing called the staticfile_buildpack.

30
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,010
Again, we'll cover all
of this in more detail

31
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,090
as the course progresses, but
we just wanted to give you

32
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,530
an experience of what
it's like to deploy an app

33
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,330
to Cloud Foundry.

34
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,620
So, provided we're in that directory where

35
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,750
the manifest exists, we
can simply type `cf push`.

36
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,000
The `push` command is what
you use to actually push

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,290
your application up to a
Cloud Foundry instance.

38
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,900
There's quite a few different flags,

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,920
and we'll use this command
again throughout the course,

40
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,350
but because we have our manifest file here

41
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,100
with the directives and the
minimum directives that we need

42
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,320
and we have our application
source in the same directory,

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,060
we can simply type `cf push`.

44
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,760
And when we do that, our
application gets uploaded

45
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,680
to Cloud Foundry.

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,520
We'll talk more about
what's happening here.

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,910
We get assigned to a particular route

48
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,820
where our application's running
and then it actually starts

49
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,593
our application and runs it.

50
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,840
You can open that URL in
a browser and you can see

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,600
that you now have an application running.

52
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,013
All you had to do, for all
intents and purposes, was assemble

53
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:09,800
a manifest file with a few
simple directives in it

54
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,693
and type `cf push`. Cloud
Foundry did the rest.
