00:00:00,276 --> 00:00:02,260
- When you go to work with
a Cloud Foundry instance

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,010
the first thing you need to
do is set the API endpoint

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,280
of the Cloud Foundry that you're using.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,140
There's a couple
different ways to do this.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,760
In this case, I'm just
using the `cf api` command

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,160
and using the URL of the API
endpoint of the Cloud Foundry

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,250
that I'm using.

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,350
Your API endpoint is probably
going to be different

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,330
than the one that I'm using.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,920
I can also use the `cf api`
command to see which API

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,670
endpoint I'm currently targeted to.

12
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,910
This is useful if you frequently

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,500
interact with a lot of different
Cloud Foundry instances.

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,220
So once you've set that API endpoint,

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,380
the next thing you need to do is login.

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,020
I'll type `cf login --help`.

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,700
You'll note that one of
the things you can do

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,690
with the login command
is set the API endpoint.

19
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,534
And so you could use the `-a` flag

20
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:49,484
and skip the `cf api` command altogether.

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,480
You will also notice that
there's a few different ways

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,100
that you can log in to a
Cloud Foundry instance.

23
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,843
We'll cover a few of those
here, but not all of them.

24
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,390
The first way that I'm going to log in

25
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,810
is just interactively.

26
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,210
I'll just type `cf login`.

27
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,870
The nice part about this is

28
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,730
that your username and
your password don't show up

29
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,598
in your terminal history. And
you can see I'm now logged

30
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:16,323
in and I'm targeted to an org and space.

31
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,060
Another way to log in is
a browser-based login.

32
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,370
I can do that with a `cf login --sso`.

33
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,480
And this is typically the
one I use most frequently

34
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,370
because what this allows you
to do is use password managers

35
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,410
like 1Password or LastPass
that are integrated

36
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,810
with your browser and
authenticate that way.

37
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,503
So let me grab this URL
and open it in a browser.

38
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,760
When you do an SSO based login,

39
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,000
you get a temporary authentication code.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,440
You then copy that authentication code

41
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,790
and paste that back in
your terminal window.

42
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,053
And you've authenticated
just the same way.

43
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,600
You can also use the
`cf target` command to

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,050
see which Cloud Foundry instance
you are currently targeted

45
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,560
and logged into.

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,110
The difference between
this `cf target` command

47
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,484
and the `cf api` command is this
also shows your org and space.

48
00:02:10,484 --> 00:02:13,234
We'll talk about those a
little bit later in the course.

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,500
Logging in is important.

50
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,280
Logging out is also important.

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,880
So `cf logout` is the command to do that.

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,130
And if you rerun that `cf target` command,

53
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,130
you'll see that I'm no longer logged in.
