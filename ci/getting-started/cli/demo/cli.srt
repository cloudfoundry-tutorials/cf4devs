1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You can check that you have the CLI installed correctly

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and see what version you are running by typing `cf version`.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you get an error when you do this, you should take a look

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
at your PATH variable and see what you have set.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Refer to the installation guide if you have any problems

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and be sure you have the CLI installed correctly before proceeding.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It is also good practice to periodically check for updates 

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and install the latest.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The CLI is extensively self-documenting.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You can see the most commonly used commands by typing `cf help`.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You can see all of the commands the CLI supports by typing `cf help -a`.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can see that this list is significantly longer.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You can see the usage details for any of the commands

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
by typing `cf <the name of the command> --help`

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In this case, I have displayed the help text for the login command.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
When you run `cf help`, you may notice that some of the 

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
commands have shortcuts after them.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I have highlighted `cf marketplace` here, 

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and you can see you can type `cf marketplace` 

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
or simply use the shortcut of `cf m`.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Not all commands have shortcuts,

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
but the ones that do are listed when you view the help text.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You can also change the language 

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that the CLI uses.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In this case I am using `cf config` to change the language to German.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
When you run `cf help` again, you can see the descriptions

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
are now in German.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You will also notice the commands do not change

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
just the text around them and the descriptions.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You can turn this off by again using `cf config`

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,933
and clearing the locale.
