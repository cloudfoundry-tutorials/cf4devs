1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- All right,

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,410
so here, we're gonna
look at some differences

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:06,570
between specifying a path
explicitly on a push and not,

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,070
and particularly we're gonna look

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,030
in the context of zip files.

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,020
So before you start this

7
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,230
make sure you're in the right directory.

8
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,290
Make sure you have the app.zip file

9
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,890
in the current directory
that you're working within.

10
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,370
Let's start by pushing this application

11
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,100
with the `-p` flag

12
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,340
and specifying our zip file.

13
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,240
And we'll take a look at what happens.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,960
When we do this,

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,410
our app gets uploaded
and our app gets started.

16
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,680
We've got a URL here.

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,750
We can grab that URL and
open it in a browser.

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,630
And as expected Cloud Foundry
will take that zip file,

19
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,763
unzip it and run it as if it
was any other application.

20
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,590
So now let's take a look at what happens

21
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,340
when we push without the `-p` flag.

22
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,010
Remember that, we are in a
current directory with app.zip

23
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,813
so the same app.zip is
going to be uploaded.

24
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Okay, so now when this application starts

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,320
and we open in a browser,

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,093
we get a 403 forbidden error from nginx.

27
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,213
But if we go back here and we actually

28
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,131
add `app.zip` to the path,

29
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:23,203
you'll see that we actually
download the zip file.

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,840
So there's two things
to keep in mind here.

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,500
One, when working with zip files

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,930
if you want Cloud Foundry
to unzip the artifact file

33
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,750
that you're pushing, you
have to specify the path.

34
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,610
Otherwise Cloud Foundry doesn't
know what to do with it.

35
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,210
We have this very valid use
case `zip-no-src-path` here

36
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,627
where we actually just want
that file to be served up

37
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,860
so that's what we're seeing
in their behavior here.

38
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,010
The second thing is it's always better

39
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,530
to get into the habit of
trying to specify the path

40
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,230
for all of the applications
that you're pushing.

41
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,930
We want repeatable deterministic behavior

42
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,460
and strange things can happen

43
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,153
if you inadvertently push
from the wrong directory.

44
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,750
So before we continue,

45
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,300
let's do a little bit of cleanup here.

46
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,520
We don't need the `zip-no-src-path`
application anymore

47
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,740
so let's just go ahead and delete it.

48
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,840
Remember the `-r` flag is
going to delete the routes

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,120
that are associated with it as well.

50
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,880
We will continue to use
the other application

51
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,870
the working application.

52
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,960
And so rather than delete it,

53
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,850
let's just go ahead and rename it.

54
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,663
So we rename it from
`zip-with-src-path` to `static app`.
