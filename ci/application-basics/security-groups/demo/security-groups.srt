1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,250
- So as a developer, you
will not have the ability

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,890
to maintain or change or
update security groups

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,220
within Cloud Foundry,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,730
but it's important to
understand how to check them

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,990
and have awareness of what they are.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,761
So security groups control
egress are essentially

7
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:19,180
where your applications can reach out to.

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,160
And operators can apply a default set

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,130
of staging security groups,

10
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,940
as well as running security groups.

11
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,700
After that, they can also
apply security groups

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,000
at the space level.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,280
So let's take a look at
the staging security groups

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,980
that I have configured in
this Cloud Foundry instance

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,203
by the operators.

16
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:40,240
You can see that I have two:

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,073
one is called public
networks, one is called DNS.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,550
For the running security groups,

19
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,790
I have the same public networks in DNS.

20
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,860
I also have a security
group called Containers

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,053
and another one called Hannah Trial.

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,410
We can look at any of these
individual security groups

23
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,710
by running CF Security
Group and the name of that.

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,590
And so I'm doing it

25
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,710
on the default DNS
security group that's here.

26
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,804
And what you'll see is
that my applications

27
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:11,210
with the DNS Security Group
are allowed to reach out

28
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,970
over the TCP protocol to any IP address

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,970
in this site or range and over port 53.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,023
And so essentially going
out to make DNS queries.
