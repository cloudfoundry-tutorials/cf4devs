1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:01,803
- I am going to demonstrate one

2
00:00:01,803 --> 00:00:04,450
of the resiliency features
built into Cloud Foundry.

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,919
This is running for every
application within the platform.

4
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:11,890
In the upper right window here,

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,500
I am rerunning `cf app`
every half a second

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,930
on my training app and you can see

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,309
that I have five instances running here.

8
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:23,180
On the left window over
here, I'm tailing the logs

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,380
for my training app. And
in the bottom window here,

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,140
I'm going to invoke an endpoint

11
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:30,210
built into the training application

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,600
that programmatically
crashes an app instance.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,050
What Cloud Foundry is doing

14
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,330
is monitoring the health of all

15
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,970
of my applications instances.

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,180
It knows that I want five running

17
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,110
and it will ensure that
five will continue to run

18
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,540
even when I programmatically
crash those instances.

19
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,820
We're going to `curl` the `/kill` endpoint

20
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,730
of my training application.

21
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,160
You can see that I get a
'502 Bad Gateway' error.

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,520
This is because the application fails to

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,160
return a response before crashing.

24
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,819
In the logs window here you
can see that very quickly

25
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:08,038
we've determined that the
application has crashed

26
00:01:08,038 --> 00:01:11,570
and that the process has crashed.

27
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,510
You can see that it ended
up being app instance two

28
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,221
over here in this window.

29
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:19,780
You can see that that app
instance was very quickly

30
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,290
determined to be nonfunctioning,

31
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,250
essentially failing it's health check

32
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,353
and it was replaced by a new instance.
