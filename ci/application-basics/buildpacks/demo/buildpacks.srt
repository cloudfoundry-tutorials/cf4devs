1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,290
- You can see the system
buildpacks configured

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,810
for your instance of Cloud Foundry

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,910
by running `cf buildpacks`.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,690
These buildpacks are
maintained by operators

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,510
of your Cloud Foundry Instance,
and they'll be updated

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,020
by the operators of your Cloud
Foundry instance as well.

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,730
In the event though that,
let's say you needed

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,310
to use a specific version
of the staticfile buildpack,

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,780
one that is not built in

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,490
with the system buildpack
that you have here,

11
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,380
you can do that by specifying
the `-b` flag and the path

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,370
to the buildpack and the
tag of that buildpack,

13
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,947
in this case it's the
1.5.21 in a Git repository,

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,210
and if enabled on your
Cloud Foundry instance,

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,310
your Cloud Foundry instance
will go out to GitHub.

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,380
It will fetch this tag,
specifically this version

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,340
of that buildpack, and
it will use that version

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,480
of the buildpack to
create the container image

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,553
for your application.
