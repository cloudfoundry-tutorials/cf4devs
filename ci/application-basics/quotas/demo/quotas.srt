00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,410
- As a developer, it's
important to understand

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,290
what quotas have been applied
to your orgs and spaces.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,260
We won't do anything in this
course with setting quotas.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,200
But we should be able
to observe them because

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,300
at some point if you use
Cloud Foundry long enough

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,433
you'll probably run up
against exhausting your quota.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,250
So if we want to look
at our org, we can do

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,410
a `cf org` and the name of
the org, and then we can

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,940
look for the name of the quota.

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,543
So in this case, it's a
pretty long GUID here.

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,560
We can then do `cf
org-quota`, and the name

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,930
of that GUID to see the values

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,350
and what I'm allocated
across the entire org.

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,320
So every space within my org

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,990
will share four gigs of memory.

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,140
I'll have an eight gig instance limit

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,310
per instance, per app instance.

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,740
Obviously I can't use all
of that because I don't

19
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,010
even have eight gigs of
memory across my org.

20
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,630
I am limited to 10 routes,
400 service instances,

21
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm allowed to generate paid services.

22
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,280
We'll talk more about that
coming up here in the class,

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,853
and I'm allowed 20 application instances.

24
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,480
I can do similar thing with the space.

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,690
I can do `cf space`.

26
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,930
I'm currently in my dev
space, and I can see

27
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,530
if there is a quota applied to my space.

28
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,100
You'll notice that there's always

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,340
a quota applied at the org level.

30
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,553
You may or may not have quotas
applied at the space level.
