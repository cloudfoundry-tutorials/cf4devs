1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,550
- We can use labels and annotations

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,390
to add more meta information

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,440
to our applications and other elements

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,900
within Cloud Foundry.

5
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,580
And this can be really
helpful for our own use

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,630
as well as to help out our teammates,

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,950
to build shared understanding
of what's happening

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,583
and what we've deployed and why.

9
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,076
So we can set labels on an
application with `cf set-label`.

10
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:24,890
In this case, we're setting it

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,543
on our app called training app.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,910
We can then look at the
labels using `cf labels`

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,153
and the name of our app.

14
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,830
We can also use `cf apps --labels`,

15
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,210
and essentially use it as a search.

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,720
So we can look for all applications

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,593
that have the `env` equal to `dev`.

18
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,290
We'll go ahead and set another label here

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,860
and similarly, you can also
search for multiple things.

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,510
All labels that have `env` equal to `dev`

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,060
or `sensitive` equal to `true`.

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,870
Now we've done this on the command line,

23
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,970
of course it would be better
to do this in a manifest.

24
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,270
And so we'd want to add our labels

25
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,150
to our manifest and make
sure that they are persistent

26
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,930
and will be there when they re-push.

27
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,380
There are no commands in the CLI currently

28
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,930
to add annotations but
we can add annotations

29
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,110
in the metadata section of the manifest.

30
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,070
Maybe we want to do something like

31
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,490
add the contact person
for this application.

32
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,973
We can do that here.

33
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,880
Perhaps also we want our CI system maybe

34
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,740
to inject the version of the application

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,510
so that at any point in
time somebody could look

36
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,440
at the application and see what version

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,613
is deployed.
