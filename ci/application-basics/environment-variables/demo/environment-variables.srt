00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,280
- The 12-factor app best practices

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,200
say to inject our configuration
through the environment.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,240
This forces us as developers

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,800
to make sure that we separate

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,580
the things that can change
within our application

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,330
from the code itself.

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,730
We've provided a training app,

8
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,590
so we'll start by pushing
that application up.

9
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,220
You should know how to do this by now:

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,050
there's a manifest provided,

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,393
and the application is
provided as a zip file.

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,910
Just to make sure we can open
our application in a browser

13
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,210
and see that it's working.

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,600
We can then set environment
variables using `cf set-env`,

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,850
we'll go ahead and set three

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,190
environment variables right now.

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,020
This application is coded in a way

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,210
where it'll display environment variables

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,300
that start with the word TRAINING

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,920
in all upper case followed by an `_`.

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,410
And that's why we're using the convention

22
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,010
that we have here now,

23
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,520
but that is obviously not a
requirement of Cloud Foundry,

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,720
that's simply how the
application's written.

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,930
If we look at the
application now in a browser,

26
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,900
we don't see the
environment variables yet,

27
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,870
and that's because we need

28
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,610
to restart our application

29
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,220
for the new environment value
or values to be picked up.

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,950
So let's go ahead and
restart the application,

31
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,530
and then we can take a
look at the application

32
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,493
in a browser again.

33
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,150
Now you can see that the
training environment variables

34
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,063
again are shown here.

35
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,260
From the CLI you can also
inspect the environment

36
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,740
for any application that's running,

37
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,370
and you'll see that there's a
`User-Provided` section here.

38
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,700
Those are the values that we just set.

39
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,470
In addition, there's a
`System-Provided` section.

40
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,430
These are set by the
platform by Cloud Foundry

41
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,900
for every single
application: `VCAP_SERVICES`

42
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,430
we'll use later when we
actually bind services

43
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,300
to our applications,
and `VCAP_APPLICATION`

44
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,400
is set for every environment
and contains information

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,540
about the specific running application

46
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,380
and application instances.

47
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,530
If you go back to the application,

48
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,610
that's where we're getting things

49
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,703
like this app instance GUID from.

50
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,810
You can change environment variables

51
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,860
by using `cf set-env`.

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,390
Again, you'll have to
restart your application

53
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,363
for those changes to take effect.

54
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,980
Of course, if you're using a
manifest, and you should be,

55
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,360
you wanna make sure that
you add these values

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,140
to the manifest so that
they don't get lost

57
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,260
when you redeploy your application.

58
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,700
So the last thing to be aware of,

59
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,410
is that operators of your
Cloud Foundry platform

60
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,920
can set two different
`environment variable groups`

61
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,650
that would be made available
to every application

62
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,200
on the platform.

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,190
You may or may not have
these values actually set,

64
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,580
it depends on if they're configured

65
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,510
by your operators or not,

66
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,690
but in this case here,
you can see that on SAP,

67
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,940
they've made available
their CredHub service

68
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,510
and provided the API end
point for that service

69
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,490
via the running
environment variable group.

70
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,530
And in the staging
environment variable group

71
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,830
they haven't set anything.
