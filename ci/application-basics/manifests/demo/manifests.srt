1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,210
- Let's take a look at the easy way

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,260
to create a manifest in

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,320
Cloud Foundry and that's to
allow Cloud Foundry to do it.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,550
All we really need is
our running application

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,490
which we've already configured
in previous exercises.

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,350
And then we can run the `cf
create-app-manifest` command.

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,620
Cloud Foundry will look at the
config that we've already set

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,800
by the command line in
the previous exercise to

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,470
deploy this application.

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,460
And you'll see that we
now have a manifest file

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,400
in the directory that we
ran this command from.

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,700
We can take a look at
the manifest file and you

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,210
can see that Cloud Foundry
put in all of the information

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,608
that it knows based on
parameters that we passed

15
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:37,660
in previously.

16
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,450
It also added things that were default.

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,940
So in this case, the stack
and the health check type.

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,790
We'll talk more about what
these are later in the course.

19
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,670
We can test this and make
sure that our manifest works

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,410
by making sure that we're
in the right directory

21
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,960
deleting our existing
application, and then pushing

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,913
by using this manifest.

23
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,720
It's important that we
always test the manifest

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,610
that Cloud Foundry
generates, because now we

25
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,920
can open this application
in a browser and see

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,450
that things aren't working.
They are not working

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,283
for the same reason

28
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:17,131
they didn't work in the
source path exercise.

29
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:18,550
So if we go back

30
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,280
and look at the manifest again

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,240
you'll see that there's no path in here.

32
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,170
And the reason that there's no path is

33
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,900
that Cloud Foundry doesn't know where

34
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,320
on your local file system

35
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,700
you actually pushed from last time.

36
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,000
That's something it can't figure out.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,300
And so what we can do
is one of two things.

38
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,920
You can add that to your manifest here

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,530
or you can simply push and
specify the path when you push.

40
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,750
And so in this case, I'm in
the appropriate directory.

41
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,200
I have app.zip, and I can
re-push. When I do this

42
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,770
and reopen the application

43
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,133
in a browser, everything will work.

44
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,610
The last thing to keep in
mind is that the precedents

45
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,390
between the command line and the manifest.

46
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,700
Anything you specify

47
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,970
on the command line will
override what's in the manifest.

48
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,230
And you can see that here
because we can do a push

49
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,870
and we can specify a larger disk size

50
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,910
in this case, 128 megs.

51
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,743
And you see

52
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:20,930
that when it actually
pushes the command line

53
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,263
value overwrites the value
that we have in the manifest.
