In this module, we get started using Cloud Foundry. We introduce the CLI or command-line interface used to interact with Cloud Foundry instances. We will deploy our first application to the platform to get a taste of what is to come.

- [The CLI](cli): An introduction to the CLI or command line interface, the tool used to interact with Cloud Foundry.
- [Using a Cloud Foundry](using-a-cf): An explanation of how to use different Cloud Foundry instances.
- [Deploy your First App](first-push): Deploy your first application to Cloud Foundry. The purpose of this section is to highlight the simplicity and capability Cloud Foundry brings to complex developer workflows.
