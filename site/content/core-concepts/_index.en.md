This module reviews the constructs that allow Cloud Foundry to securely and effectively support multiple users, projects, and tenants.

- [Organizations and Spaces](orgs-and-spaces): Orgs and spaces are used to divide up a Cloud Foundry instance so that it can be used by multiple teams, projects, tenants, etc.
- [Role-Based Access Control](rbac): Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to control what you can do in Cloud Foundry.
- [Resource Names](resource-names): Resource names provide human readable labels to resources in Cloud Foundry.
