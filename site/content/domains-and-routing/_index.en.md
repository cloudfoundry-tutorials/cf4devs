In this module, we discuss the use of domains and routes with applications, covering both internal and external facing domains.

- [Route Basics](route-basics): An introduction to basic routing in Cloud Foundry.
- [Application Domains](application-domains): Examines the different domains available to users in Cloud Foundry.
- [Internal Domains](internal-domains): Routes based on internal domains are only resolvable by other apps in that same Cloud Foundry deployment.
- [Route Services](route-services): Route services are an optional feature that allow for pre and post processing of http traffic.
