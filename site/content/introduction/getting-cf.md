# Getting access to Cloud Foundry

You will need access to a Cloud Foundry instance to complete the course. If your company has an instance, you are welcome to use that. Otherwise, we recommend you pick one of the options below that offer free trial.

## The "open core" model

Cloud Foundry follows an "open core" model. This means the core functionality in the platform is standardized across all commercial distributions. However, commercial providers can and do provide different services (like databases, message queues, etc). Additionally, commercial providers can disable or enable optional features. While most aspects of the course should work on all platforms, you may run into features that do not work on one of the platforms below.
