Welcome to Cloud Foundry for Developers! This course is aimed at developers and DevSecOps engineers using the Cloud Foundry platform. The course does not cover all aspects and features of Cloud Foundry. It is scoped to "typical" developer use cases. The course does not address the installation and operation of Cloud Foundry.

## Topics

1. **Getting Started**: In this module, we get started using Cloud Foundry. We introduce the CLI or command-line interface used to interact with Cloud Foundry instances. We will deploy our first application to the platform to get a taste of what is to come.
2. **Core Concepts**: This module reviews the constructs that allow Cloud Foundry to securely and effectively support multiple users, projects, and tenants.
3. **Application Basics**: In this module, we take you through the basics of deploying and managing applications in Cloud Foundry.
4. **Application Lifecycle**: In this section, we take you through the lifecycle management of applications in Cloud Foundry. We cover the ideal workloads for the platform, as well as the basics of troubleshooting and common issues that sometimes arise.
5. **Services**: In this module we will look at common capabilities surrounding the management of service instances in Cloud Foundry. We will cover managed services provided by service brokers, as well as user-provided services.
6. **Domains and Routing**: In this module, we discuss the use of domains and routes, covering both internal and external facing domains.
7. **Advanced Concepts**: In this module, we cover some of the more advanced features of Cloud Foundry.

## Applications

The course use applications contained in this [zip file](../../applications.zip). Be sure to download the [applications.zip](../../applications.zip), unzip it, and have the applications available before continuing.

## Conventions

**Code Blocks**: We will use code blocks and `inline code` to denote commands run in the terminal window as well as examples of output from the commands. The following example expects you to run the pwd command.
```
pwd
```

We also use code blocks to show representative output from running commands. For example, if you run `pwd` above, you can expect to see output similar to:

```
/Users/steve/workspace
```

**Variables**: In the instructions, we place variables inside of less than < and greater than > keys. You should supply your specific values in place of these blocks. For example, if you see <USERNAME> in a code block, you should replace it with your username.

## Videos

Most, but not all, course sections have a corresponding video. Videos are intended to demonstrate and discuss some of the concepts introduced in the section. All videos contain a closed captioning track in English.

## Applications

Sample applications are provided in a zip file. Each section will reference the needed applications by name. Note the applications are built for training purposes. Therefore you should use caution before leveraging the code or patterns in production applications.
