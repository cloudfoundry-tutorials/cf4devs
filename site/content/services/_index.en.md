In this module we will look at common capabilities surrounding the management of service instances in Cloud Foundry. We will cover managed services provided by service brokers, as well as user-provided services.

- [Managed Services](managed-services): Managed services are self-service instances available for provisioning. This section describes how to view available services, as well as how to deploy and bind them to applications.
- [Service Keys](service-keys): Service keys can be used to generate a unique set of credentials for accessing a service instance outside of the context of an application.
- [Sharing Service Instances](sharing-service-instances): Sharing service instances allows one service instance to be bound to multiple apps in different spaces.
- [User Provided Services](upsi): User-provided service instances are a means to connect services provisioned outside of Cloud Foundry's marketplace to applications.
