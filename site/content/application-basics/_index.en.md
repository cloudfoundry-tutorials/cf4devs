In this module, we take you through the basics of deploying and managing applications in Cloud Foundry.

- [Source Paths](source-paths): A mechanism for specifying the location of application content when pushing applications.
- [Manifests](manifests): Manifests provide declarative configuration for an application. This section discusses how to make a manifest, and why they're a good approach when combined with version control.
- [Buildpack Basics](buildpacks): Buildpacks are used to containerize applications. In this section, we briefly look at how buildpacks work in Cloud Foundry.
- [Environment Variables](environment-variables): Examines the method for passing environment variables to applications.
- [Metadata](metadata): Metadata allows you to provide additional information to resources with labels and annotations.
- [Scaling](scaling): Apps can be scaled both horizontally and vertically in Cloud Foundry. This section describes the procedure for both.
- [Logs](logs): Log output contains lots of useful information about an application, and is essential for troubleshooting.
- [Resiliency](resiliency): Cloud Foundry is ensuring the correct number of app instances are running. This section demonstrates one of the resiliency features built into the platform.
- [Quotas](quotas): Quotas are named sets of memory, service, and instance usage limits that apply to an org or space. As a Cloud Foundry developer, it's important to understand what quotas are applied to the space you're working in.
- [Application Security Groups](security-groups): Application security groups can be used to restrict egress from both staging and running apps.
