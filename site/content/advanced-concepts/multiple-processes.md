A single app in Cloud Foundry can consist of multiple processes running in separate containers. This is different from the sidecar processes we looked at earlier, which share a single container.

One of the most common use cases for multiple processes is a web app that has both a UI process and a worker process.

> Note: Running apps with multiple processes uses more system resources. If you are running in an environment with limited resources, you may need to delete the apps you have running from earlier sections to allow you to deploy the app in this section.

## Push an App with Multiple Processes

An app with multiple processes can be pushed by either passing a Procfile to `cf push`, or by declaring the multiple processes in the app manifest. We'll start by trying the Procfile approach.

## Passing Procfiles to `cf push`

To push an app that creates multiple processes from the same codebase, you list each process in the manifest. Here, you need to specify a start command for each process as the buildpack won't know how to distinguish between each process.

```

applications:
- name: multi-process
  buildpacks:
  - nodejs_buildpack
  processes:
  - type: web
    instances: 1
    memory: 64M
    command: node main.js web
  - type: worker
    instances: 2
    memory: 32M
    command: node main.js worker
```

> Note: You can also specify start commands by providing a Procfile. If you'd like to learn more about Procfiles we recommend taking a look at the [Cloud Foundry API documentation](https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/index.html#procfiles).

Let's try pushing the `multi-process` app. 

```
cf push --random-route
```

You should now be able to view the running processes on the app:
```
cf app multi-process
```

You should see the details of your running processes in the output. By default, the web process has a route and one instance, and other processes have zero instances (in our case we specified two instances for the worker process, which overrides the default).

## Scale a Process
Processes can be scaled independently. There's an additional `--process` flag that can be passed to the `cf scale` command to achieve this.

Let's scale the web process to two instances:
```
cf scale multi-process --process web -i 2
```

We can do the same for the worker process:

```
cf scale multi-process --process worker -i 3
```

## cf SSH
When running apps with multiple processes, you use pass the `--process` flag to `cf ssh` into the container for a specific process. For example:
```
cf ssh multi-process --process web
```

## Tidy up
When you're done with the exercise, you can exit the `web` container and delete the multi-process app. We won't be using it again in this course.
